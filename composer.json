    "description": "An example of how a web development agency (or any team managing many Drupal websites) can use a stand-alone Composer package containing just a composer.json to list all of the modules (and themes and other packages) that they like to use on all D8 projects. This repo/package is not meant for use on real sites and the modules listed in composer.json are not meant as a comprehensive starting point. This repo is only meant to be used in demonstrations by the Pantheon Agency and Community team when discussing options for sharing/reusing code amongst development teams.",
